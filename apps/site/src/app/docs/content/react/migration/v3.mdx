# v3 Migration Guide

Material Tailwind React 3.0 introduces a number of breaking changes, improvements and new features to make the library more flexible and easier to use.

Below is a list of all breaking changes and how to migrate your code to the new version.

---

## Base Changes

### withMT()

The `withMT()` function is removed and doesn't work anymore, instead you can use the `mtConfig` as plugin in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

<CodePreview>
```ts
// highlight(1,5)
import { mtConfig } from "@material-tailwind/react";
 
const config = {
  content: [...],
  plugins: [mtConfig],
};
 
export default config;
```
</CodePreview>

### Theme Provider

On `v3` you don't need to wrap your application with the `<ThemeProvider />` component anymore. You only need to do this if you want to use custom theme and style for your components.

### Animations

On `v3` we dropped <Link href="https://www.framer.com/motion/animation/" target="_blank">Framer Motion</Link> and components are not animated by default anymore. You can still use Framer Motion or any other animation library to animate your components.

This helps to reduce the bundle size, improve the performance and make the components more flexible to be used with any animation library.

### Color Prop

On `v3` we reduced the amount of colors used for the components, this helps to make a consistent color palette across the components and make it easier to manage the colors.

<CodePreview>
```tsx
// ❌ v2
type color =
  | "white"
  | "black"
  | "blue-gray"
  | "gray"
  | "brown"
  | "deep-orange"
  | "orange"
  | "amber"
  | "yellow"
  | "lime"
  | "light-green"
  | "green"
  | "teal"
  | "cyan"
  | "light-blue"
  | "blue"
  | "indigo"
  | "deep-purple"
  | "purple"
  | "pink"
  | "red";
 
// ✅ v3
type color =
  | "primary"
  | "secondary"
  | "info"
  | "success"
  | "warning"
  | "error";
```
</CodePreview>

### Variant Prop

On `v3` the values for `variant` prop is changed.

<CodePreview>
```tsx
// ❌ v2
type variant = "filled" | "outlined" | "gradient" | "text";
 
// ✅ v3
type variant = "solid" | "outline" | "gradient" | "ghost";
```
</CodePreview>

### Full Width Prop

On `v3` the `fullWidth` prop is replaced with `isFullWidth` prop.
